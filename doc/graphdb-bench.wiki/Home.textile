GraphDB-Bench is an extensible graph database benchmarking tool. Its goal is to provide an easy-to-use library for defining and running application/domain-specific benchmarks against different graph database implementations. To achieve this the core code-base has been kept relatively simple, through extensive use of lower layers in the "TinkerPop":http://github.com/tinkerpop stack.

In addition to the benchmarking framework, GraphDB-Bench also includes a collection of artificial graph generation code.

The documentation herein will provide all the information necessary for understanding how to define benchmarks, generate synthetic graphs, run benchmarks on these loaded graphs, and evaluate benchmark results. 

Finally, note that each benchmark described in this documentation has provided results for those not desiring to run the benchmarks on their local machines.
